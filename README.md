A simple react-based web app to get weather forecasts in multiple places. Auto-complete made possible with the [Mapzen Search API](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/autocomplete/) and weather forecasts are from [version 3 of the National Weather Service's API](https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/documentation).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
